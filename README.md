## Learning the essential of ECMAScript 6 (ECMAScript 2015) - ES6

Before start reading this repo, It's better to check my codes/notes/comment in JavaScript repos to refresh your info in case if you need to review the essential of programming with JavaScript. 

This repo is talking about the new and the advanced feature that have been added to JavaScript. We all need to be familiar with these new techniques as they are used in the JavaScript framework like ReactJS for example. This repo will be also focusing about using OOP with JavaScript. 

JavaScript in a nutshell:
- Was created in 1995 by Netscape with the name "JavaScript"
- Adopted by Microsoft as JScript
- European Computer Manufacturers Association standardized the specifications for JavaScript language and browser implementations. After the foundation of ECMA, they released:
    -- ECMAScript 1 in 1997
    -- ECMAScript 2 in 1998
    -- ECMAScript 3 in 1999
    -- ECMAScript 4 (Not Available): was met with a bunch of controversies, and lacked sufficient support from browser vendors to be released and was ultimately abandoned
    -- ECMAScript 5 in 2009
    -- ECMAScript 6 in 2015
    -- ECMAScript 2020, 2021, etc...
