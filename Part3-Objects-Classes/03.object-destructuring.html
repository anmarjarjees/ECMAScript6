            Object destructuring: is used to assigning to new variable names
            A property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable 
            with a different name than the object property.

        // Quick recap about what we do in JavaScript before ES6:
        // let's create an object literal:
        let employee = {
            name: 'Alex Chow',
            title: 'Instructor',
            dob: '1974-02-05',
            gender: 'Male',
            department: 'Continuing Studies',
            campuses: ['Toronto', 'Markham'],
            edu: {
                topic: 'Software Development',
                level: 'College Certificate',
                college: 'Centennial College',
                year: '2018'
            },
            contact: {
                cellPhone: "(416) 123-1234",
                homePhone: "(905) 123-4321",
                email: "alexchow@learningjavascript.com"
            }
        }

        // to access each value of this object we use:
        let fullName = employee.name;
        let jobTitle = employee.title;
        let campus1 = employee.campuses[0];
        let education = employee.edu.level;
        let subject = employee.edu.topic;

        document.write(`<p>${fullName} is our new ${jobTitle}. He has a ${education} in ${subject}. This semester, he will be working at ${campus1} campus.</p>`);

        // Let's try to use the "Destructuring" feature of ES6:
        // repeat the same output from the above with different solution:
        /*
        1. Since we need to destruct these values from an object,
        so we need to use curly braces {}
        Remember with arrays we used square brackets [] to destruct array values

        2. Inside the {}, we need to list/specify the list of our new variables
        to assign to them the new values from our object "employee"

        IMPORTANT NOTES:
        1. Please be advised that the variable names that we will list in between {}
        must match it's corresponding properties names in our object. 
        Unless we do prefer/want to use different names then keep reading in this file :-)

        For example: to get or to assign the value of the property "topic" into a new variable,
        this variable name has to be named also "topic".

        If you noticed in the previous code we wrote: 
        let education = employee.edu.level;
        so we are assigning the value of "level" to a variable named "eduction"
        But this is not the case with Object Destructing

        2. The order of the elements has no effect, and skipping elements with commas ,, 
        as we did before with array also has no effect with object.
        so we don't need to list the variable in the same order of the properties objects,
        and we don't need to skip unwanted properties by adding commas ,,
        */

        // Let's start with the simple key/value properties:
        let { name, title, department, campuses, } = employee;
        document.write(`<p>${fullName} is our new ${jobTitle}. He us in ${department} department.  This semester, he will be working at ${campuses[0]} campus.</p>`);

        // Q) What if we want to use different names!
        // The solution is we need to use something called alias names:
        // The syntax: propertyName : variableName
        /* 
        Notice that:
        - we still need to reference the object property that we want to use even with alias names
        - we put a varaible named "address" that doesn't have a matching property!
        in such case, JS will not though an error, it will just give it a value of "undefined"
        - we put a variable named "hobby" that doesn't have a matching property also! 
        but we can give it a default value of "Music". 
        So we can give a default value to any varaible and this value will only be used if there is no matching
        */
        let { name: givenName, dob: birthDate, gender, address, hobby = "music" } = employee;
        document.write(`<p>${givenName} was born in ${birthDate}. He is a ${gender}. He likes ${hobby}.</p>`);
        document.write(`<p>Address: ${address}</p>`); // Address: undefined

        /*
        What if we want to distrust the "employee" object property named "edu" which is a nested object:
        edu: {
            topic: 'Software Development',
            level: 'College Certificate',
            college: 'Centennial College',
            year: '2018'
        }
        */
        let { edu } = employee;
        document.write(`<p>${name} has a ${edu.level} in ${edu.topic} from ${edu.college} in ${edu.year}.</p>`);

        /*
        Or we can use the same technique of object distrusting:
        Notice in this way/solution:
        - we can specify the property that we want to use instead of taking them all
        - we still need to match the variable name with the property name
        - we can access the inner property of the nested object directly 
        */
        let { contact: { cellPhone, email } } = employee;
        // No need for contact.cellPhone => just cellPhone
        // No need for contact.email => just email
        document.write(`<p>You can contact ${name} through his email ${email}, or call him directly to his cell phone number: ${cellPhone}.</p>`);

        // ****************
        // More Examples :-)
        // ****************

        // Yes, we can do destructuring directly:
        const { make, brand, year, price } = {
            make: "Toyota",
            brand: "Corolla",
            model: "Sedan",
            color: "white",
            milage: 123000.00,
            year: 2015,
            price: 15000
        }
        document.write(`<br>${make} - ${brand} - ${year}`);

        // Let's convert/assign the above example into an object varaible
        const carForSale = {
            make: "Toyota",
            brand: "Corolla",
            model: "Sedan",
            color: "white",
            milage: 123000.00,
            year: 2015,
            price: 15000
        }

        // Creating a function for selling the car:
        // We only need the brand, model, year, and price
        function sellCar({ brand, model, year, price }) {
            return `<p>This ${brand} ${model} ${year} is for sale. Price is ${price} and it's negotiable!</p>`;
        }

        document.write(`${sellCar(carForSale)}`);
