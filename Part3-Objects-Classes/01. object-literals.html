        To Recap:
        String literals: A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double (") or single quotation marks (').    
        
        Examples:
        "bar"
        '1234'
        'one line \n new line'
        "John's cat"
        
        Object Literals:
        An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object,
        enclosed in curly braces ({}).

        IMPORTANT NOTE:
        Although property "check" has the value of a function "checkCar()"

        We CANNOT access/call it by using:
