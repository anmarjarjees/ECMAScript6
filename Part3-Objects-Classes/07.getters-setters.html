        /*
           JavaScript Accessors (Getters and Setters):
           ECMAScript 5 (ES5-2009) introduced Getter and Setters.
           Getters and setters allow you to define Object Accessors (Computed Properties). 

           Getters and Setters can be used with Classes and Object literal

           - getter (get method): for getting the value of a specific property of a class/object
           The get syntax binds an object property 
           to a function that will be called when that property is looked up.

           - setter: for setting the value of a specific property of a class/object
           The set syntax binds an object property 
           to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property.

           NOTE: Please be advised that "this" keyword is required to access class methods also
        */

        // Example of using Getters/Setters with Object Literal:
        let registered = {
            _list: [], // creating an empty list property

            // using setter with addName() method to set/insert a name into the _list property
            set addName(name) {
                this._list.push(name);
            },

            // using getter with list() method to get/return a list array as a string joined with "," 
            get list() {
                return this._list.join(", ");
            }
        }

        // Put Getter/Setter into action:

        /*
        NOTE:
        Please be careful that the following code will throw an error:
        
        > registered.addName("Alex Chow");
        
        Uncaught TypeError: registered.addName is not a function

        Although addName() is a function inside the object "registered" so it's a method,
        but we can call it like .addName() due to the "set" keyword
        so we can treat it as an object property and passing its value with the assignment operator
        */
        // registered.addName("Alex Chow"); // Error sorry "Alex Chow" :-(

        // The right syntax/code for using/calling a method with "set"
        registered.addName = "Sam Simpson";
        registered.addName = "Sarah Grayson";
        console.log(registered.list); // Martin Smith, Sarah Grayson

        // Adding more names:
        registered.addName = "Martin Smith";
        registered.addName = "Elton John";

        // Same thing with get, we cannot call the list method using .list() => has to be .list
        console.log(registered.list); // Sam Simpson, Sarah Grayson, Martin Smith, Elton John

        // Another Example from MDN with more...:
        class Rectangle {
            /*
                The constructor method is a special method 
                for creating and initializing an object created with a class.

                passing h for height and w for width
            */
            constructor(h, w) {
                this.height = h;
                this.width = w;
            }

            // Method:
            // Creating our custom method (In-Class Function) to return the area of a rectangle:
            /*
            We can name it calcArea for "Calculate Area"
            Notes:
            - No need to pass any parameters for the width and height
            as this method will use the class properties (width and height) that we already set 
            inside the constructor method 
            - Don't forget to use "this" keyword with the class properties
            */
            calcArea() {
                return this.height * this.width;
            }

            // Getter: for getting the value of the rectangle area:
            /*
            IMPORTANT NOTE:
            Please notice that even "area()" is the getter method,
            we don't use parentheses when we want to get the property value
            */
            get area() {
                return this.calcArea();
            }

            // Setter: for setting a value for any class property
            set setHeight(h) {
                this.height = h;
            }

            set setWidth(w) {
                this.width = w;
            }
        } // End class Rectangle

        // creating a new instance:
        const rec1 = new Rectangle(10, 20);
        // Since we can access calcArea() so we can use it:
        document.write(`<p>The area of the first rectangle is ${rec1.calcArea()}</p>`);
        // The area of the first rectangle is 200

        // Override the rectangle properties values for width and height:
        rec1.setHeight = 12;
        rec1.setWidth = 7;
        document.write(`<p>The new area of the first rectangle after changing its width and height is ${rec1.calcArea()}</p>`);

        // Or with using the getter:
        // This code will throw an error as we cannot use () with get methods:
        // Uncaught TypeError: rec1.area is not a function
        // let recArea = rec1.area();

        // We have to use the getter method without ()
        let recArea = rec1.area;
        document.write(`<p>The new area of the first rectangle after changing its width and height is ${recArea}</p>`);
