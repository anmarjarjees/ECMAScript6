        Simplify the code of AJAX API request from the previous example
        by using "Fetch"

        - The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources
          (including across the network). 
        
        - It has the same functionality of XMLHttpRequest, 
          but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.

        - It uses "Promises" to deliver more flexible features to make requests to servers from the web browsers.

        - It requires only one parameter which is the URL of the resource that you want to fetch

        - Since fetch() method returns a "Promise", so you can use  .then() and .catch() methods to handle it

        A basic fetch request is really simple to set up. Have a look at the following code:

        fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => console.log(data));

        fetch() does not directly return the JSON response body 
        but instead returns a promise that resolves with a Response object.

        const url = 'https://anmarjarjees.github.io/json-examples/music-inst.json';

        // for testing:
        let res = fetch(url);
        console.log(res);
        /*

        fetch("http//api.non-exists-website-demo.org/no-jason-file.json")
            .then(response => {
                // handle the response
                console.log(response);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                // handle the error
                /*
                Beside the JS errors, you will see this error message
                */
                console.log("The error that we have is: " + error);
                // The error that we have is: TypeError: Failed to fetch
            });

        // taking the response object that is being returned from fetch()
        // Notice that "response" is just a naming convention
        fetch(url).then((response) => console.log(response));
        /*
        Response {type: 'cors', url: 'https://anmarjarjees.github.io/json-examples/music-inst.json', redirected: false, status: 200, ok: true, …}

        // Because the then() argument is "response" and what we want to console.log is "response" also
        // So we can omit the "response"
        fetch(url).then(console.log); // same output as above

        /*
        The response object that's returned by fetch()
        has a function (method) name json()
        this "json()" method parses the body as JSON

        As you see the result above there is a "body" property
        that contains the data
