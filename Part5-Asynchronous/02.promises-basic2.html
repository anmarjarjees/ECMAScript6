    <title>Using Promises 2</title>

        // Another example of using Promises:
        /*
        Again create a function, and let's name it "waitFor"

        instead of using the classical syntax:
        
        function myFunction(seconds) {
            return new Promise( ... our code ... )
        }
        const waitingTime = myCallbackFunction(5);

        OR:
        const waitFor = function(seconds) {

        }

        Or:
        using the ES6 syntax (arrow function), create the variable "waitFor" as a function:
        const waitFor = (seconds) => new Promise((resolve)=>)

        waitFor() function:
        - will take number of seconds as parameter
        - will return a new promise object
        
        new Promise() will take a callback function "resolve" as shown below and as we learned before
        Notice that we are passing one parameter named "resolve" as we are only interested in the passing result

        Then setting a time for the number of milliseconds (x 1000) to wait for
        we are passing the time in seconds for simplicity, but we are changing it to milliseconds inside setTimeout()
        also setTimeout function will also take the "resolve" as the callback function
        */
        const waitFor = (seconds) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000));

        console.log("You will read this message right away");

        waitFor(2).then(() => console.log("After 2 seconds, now you can read me :-)"));
        waitFor(6).then(() => console.log("After 6 seconds, now you can read me :-)"));
        waitFor(10).then(() => console.log("After 10 seconds, now you can read me :-)"));

        // Again: this time we want to use both resole if accepted/passed and reject if rejected/failed
        // let's make another function named waitForOrCancel():
        // the changes we made below:
        // - add reject callback function
        // - since we need to add more lines so we have to use { } for the arrow callback function
        // Don't forget that resolve and reject are chosen by convention, so it could res, rej or anything else
        const waitForOrCancel = (seconds) =>
            new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                // adding if condition to validate if we are passing a number or not
                if (typeof seconds !== "number") {
                    // if not a number, throwing a new Error
                    reject(new Error("the parameter 'seconds' has to be a numeric value"));
                }
                setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000)
            });

        waitForOrCancel(12).then(() => console.log("After 12 seconds, now you can read me also :-)"));
        waitForOrCancel(16).then(() => console.log("After 16 seconds, now you can read me also :-)"));
        waitForOrCancel(20).then(() => console.log("After 20 seconds, now you can read me also :-)"));
        // let try the rejection:
        waitForOrCancel("abc").then(() => console.log("You will not see this message :-("));
        /*
            Notice that you will see this error message immediately as there is no valid waiting time:
            Uncaught (in promise) Error: the parameter 'seconds' has to be a numeric value
        */
